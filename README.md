# dotfiles
My dotfiles for sway **anyone** can use or modify.

# Display Managers

I recommend using [ly](https://codeberg.org/fairyglade/ly) as a display manager.

## Installation 

### Arch Linux
On arch linux you can easily install ly with: `sudo pacman -S ly`

### Debian
On debian however it is very very painful to install ly.
First install brew: `sudo apt install brew`
Second install with brew zig: `brew install zig`
Finally compile and install ly with [these instructions](https://codeberg.org/fairyglade/ly).
